              <h2>Become a web developer</h2>
              <p>Skills make us capable to succeed in our goals. Through my academic education and extracurricular experiences, I have gathered some skills. I’m definitely proud of the skills I’ve gained across the years, and lucky to have the support of those to follow my passion for Teaching. But what I’m most proud of is my perseverance through it all. Read through my site to discover how you can be benefitted from my skills.
  
              I am the king of failure! I learn from my past and apply it in the present to create a better future If I failed I take it as an opportunity to achieve it in a new way because the problem is not an opportunity for everyone. Technology is a blessing if we use it in the right way and I have adopted the technologies so that learning can be so easy to spread to other people.</p>
